# Canto-friends

A small app to help me learn Cantonese.

I'm having real trouble remembering which tone the numbers 1-6 represent.

I thought it would be useful to have a site that would convert the tones into a visual image.

Of course, there is so much more to effective cantonese (for starters, there aren't _really_ only 6 tones!)
but I'm finding this is a useful starting point for my journey.
